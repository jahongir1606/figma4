                    <p class="writing">Step 1: Download the plugin from Figma community, search Ghost UXWriter <br>
                        Step 2: Open the plugin on your artboard <br>
                        Step 3: Search for your copy or look through the different categories of the copies <br>
                        Step 4: Select the type of error you are looking for. You will get three different copies for
                        each error <br>
                        Step 5: Tap on the cards to insert text in your frames <br>
                        And you are all geared up to make your UX copies more fun and exciting ðŸ˜Ž</p>
